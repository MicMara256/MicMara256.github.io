            This was made by Micah Halter, an eight grader at <a href="https://aceraschool.org">Acera</a> as his IMP project from September 2025 - January 2026.<br>
            The project is entitled Creating a website with math on a raspberry pi!<br>
            The first thing I did while creating the project was creating the prime factors page "WorkNowThatItIsNotInTextEditPleasePleasePlease.html." It wasn't opening with file:// when I tried to write the html page in TextEdit, but it did in VSCODE<br>
            The next thing was following <a href =https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/set-up-raspberry-pi>a </a><a href =https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/set-up-raspberry-pi>tutorial </a>on installing a distro of debian linux designed for the raspberry pi on the raspberrt pi.<br>
            Next, I created the fraction simplify page. I kept adding things, like complex number support and stuff like that, so I decided to try to atuomate algebra.<br>
            This ended up being my downfall. Here is the paraggraph I wrote for my trifold poster:<br>
            <br>
            This is the current and longest phase. I realized that the fraction simplifier was going to evolve into something that could just do algebra for me so I decided to make it intentional. Ms. Emi introduced me to the Shunting-Yard Algorithm which converts normal infix notation into reverse polish notation, where 2 + 4 would be written as 2, 4, +. This eliminated the need for parentheses. Then I made a tokenizer, to get an input string into what is really meant, so 426 would be one token, as would 4, 2, and 6. Then I tried to make it so that it would simplify. It was very hard to do in reverse polish so I am currently working on doing it in regular infix notation.<br>
            Even disregarding parentheses, and even spending every free moment on it at the last minute, it was not completed. As of the time of writing, it has an inconceivable bug, <br>
            <br>
            Inspiration came from two projects I had done in the past, the first being installing linux on a 2001 G3 macbook clamshell, and the other collaboratively making a massive spreadsheet with a bunch of math tools that I was using in math class for the 2024-2025 school year.<br>
